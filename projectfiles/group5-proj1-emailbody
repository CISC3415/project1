When running the two programs in the simulator, the simulated robot turns about 140 degrees between forward movements, and the movement distances are not anywhere near three feet. Although the real robot has a fairly accurate movement along a three-foot square, the simulated robot does not simply because it was not modeled after the Roomba. The specifications of the Roomba, such as movement velocity and rotational velocity are unknown to the Player/Stage program at the time of testing. If the simulated robot was instead a  simulated Roomba, the programs may allow for a more accurate simulation, although even between Roombas, there could be physical differences that can affect the results.
